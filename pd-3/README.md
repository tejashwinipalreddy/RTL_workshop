# CMOS Inverter Design, Characterization, SKY130A Standard-Cell Layout & 16-Mask CMOS Fabrication
---

## 📌 Overview

This module presents a complete practical flow of CMOS inverter design, transistor-level SPICE simulation, circuit characterization, SKY130A standard-cell layout, layout extraction, extracted SPICE simulation, and CMOS fabrication.

The work begins with the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using SPICE. The inverter is characterized by studying its transient response, input and output waveforms, rise time, fall time, propagation delay, voltage transfer characteristics, switching threshold, and the effect of PMOS/NMOS transistor sizing.

The design is then taken into the SKY130A standard-cell physical design flow. The required design repository and technology files are prepared, the CMOS inverter layout is examined, the standard-cell boundary is defined, and power and ground connections are established.

The physical layout is subsequently extracted to obtain the electrical representation of the implemented circuit. The extracted information is used to generate a SPICE-compatible netlist, which is simulated using NGSPICE. The resulting transient waveforms are analyzed to verify the functionality and electrical behaviour of the extracted CMOS inverter.

The module also covers the major stages of the 16-mask CMOS fabrication process, starting from silicon substrate preparation and progressing through active-region formation, well formation, gate formation, LDD implantation, source/drain formation, contact formation, and metal interconnection.

Overall, this module establishes the complete relationship between circuit-level design, simulation, physical implementation, layout extraction, post-layout verification, and CMOS fabrication technology.

# 1. CMOS Inverter SPICE Simulation and Characterization

## 1.1 CMOS Inverter and SPICE Model Setup

The first stage of the module focuses on setting up the CMOS inverter for transistor-level simulation. A CMOS inverter consists of a **PMOS transistor connected to the supply voltage** and an **NMOS transistor connected to ground**.

The SPICE model provides the electrical characteristics of the MOS devices and allows the inverter to be analyzed under realistic device parameters. The transistor dimensions, supply voltage and input waveform are selected before performing the simulation.


The simulation setup is important because the accuracy of the output waveform and delay measurements depends on the correct device models and circuit parameters. The NMOS and PMOS dimensions are selected according to the required inverter design.

---

## 1.2 Simulation Environment and Device Parameters

The next stage involves configuring the simulation environment and defining the required transistor parameters. The width-to-length ratio of the PMOS and NMOS devices has a direct effect on the switching behavior of the inverter.

The selected dimensions determine the relative drive strengths of the pull-up and pull-down networks. Proper sizing is required to obtain balanced rise and fall characteristics.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (145)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49059bca-d76c-4928-a2fa-280ebf9307f5" />


**Figure 2: Device parameters and simulation configuration**

The parameters specified here are later used by SPICE to calculate the transient response and voltage-transfer characteristics of the CMOS inverter.

---

## 1.3 SPICE Simulation Execution

After defining the circuit and device parameters, the SPICE simulation is executed. The simulator solves the electrical behavior of the inverter as the input voltage changes with time.

The input signal is applied to the common gate terminal of the PMOS and NMOS transistors. Depending on the input voltage, one transistor turns ON while the other turns OFF, producing the inverted output.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (146)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/939cf014-7cdb-481e-9814-b36432bc3de8" />



**Figure 3: Execution of CMOS inverter SPICE simulation**

This step verifies that the inverter operates correctly before detailed timing and static characterization are performed.

---

## 1.4 Input and Output Waveforms

The transient simulation produces both the input and output waveforms. The output waveform is complementary to the input waveform, demonstrating the fundamental operation of the CMOS inverter.

When the input is LOW, the PMOS transistor conducts and the output is pulled towards the supply voltage. When the input becomes HIGH, the NMOS transistor conducts and the output is pulled towards ground.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (147)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5eef6f2-4ef7-42f5-8e06-9d0101f20d30" />



**Figure 4: CMOS inverter input and output waveforms**

The waveform confirms the correct logical inversion operation and also provides the information required for measuring propagation delay and transition times.

---

## 1.5 Transient Response Analysis

The transient response is examined to understand how quickly the inverter responds to changes in the input signal.

The transition of the output does not occur instantaneously because the transistor network and load capacitance require a finite amount of time to charge or discharge. This delay is an important performance parameter in digital circuits.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (148)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/093dfd64-273a-4b05-9e0b-a35b6f7cbbed" />


**Figure 5: Transient response of the CMOS inverter**

The measured waveform is used to determine parameters such as rise time, fall time and propagation delay.

---

## 1.6 Detailed Waveform Observation

The simulation waveform is further examined over a selected time interval. This allows the transition points of the input and output signals to be identified accurately.

The time difference between corresponding input and output transitions represents the propagation delay of the inverter.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (149)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/163d8c7a-308b-4075-93cb-1089ac653b46" />



**Figure 6: Detailed observation of the transient waveform**

Accurate waveform observation is necessary for obtaining reliable timing measurements and comparing different transistor sizing conditions.

---

## 1.7 Effect of PMOS/NMOS Sizing

The performance of a CMOS inverter strongly depends on the relative sizing of the PMOS and NMOS transistors. Different width ratios are therefore simulated and compared.

Increasing transistor width increases the available drive current and can reduce the time required to charge or discharge the load. However, excessive sizing also increases capacitance and may affect overall performance.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (150)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5589897-81eb-474e-8f26-f2641be5417f" />


**Figure 7: Effect of transistor sizing on inverter behavior**

The comparison helps identify a suitable PMOS-to-NMOS sizing ratio for achieving balanced inverter operation.

---

## 1.8 Static Behavior Evaluation

Static characterization is performed using the **Voltage Transfer Characteristic (VTC)** of the CMOS inverter.

The VTC represents the relationship between the input voltage and output voltage. It shows three important operating regions: the logic HIGH region, the transition region and the logic LOW region.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (151)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fc3f090-13f4-42ff-9857-66aa0516e2b9" />


**Figure 8: Static voltage-transfer characteristic**

The steep transition region indicates the switching behavior of the inverter. A well-designed CMOS inverter provides clear logic levels and good noise margins.

---

## 1.9 CMOS Inverter Robustness

The VTC curves for different transistor sizing ratios are compared to study the robustness of the inverter.

The switching point changes when the relative strength of the PMOS and NMOS devices changes. By comparing these curves, the effect of sizing on the logic threshold and inverter symmetry can be understood.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (153)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/821c8469-2f7e-4a3f-b127-48a50eee15b1" />

<p align="center">
<img src="images/09.jpg" width="800">
</p>

**Figure 9: CMOS inverter robustness evaluation**

This analysis is useful for selecting a device ratio that provides stable switching behavior and acceptable noise margins.

---

## 1.10 Switching Threshold Voltage

The switching threshold voltage is the input voltage at which the inverter changes from its HIGH-output state to its LOW-output state.

The threshold voltage is affected by the transistor characteristics, device sizing, body voltage and fabrication parameters. The body effect is particularly important when the source-to-body voltage is not zero.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (155)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9664ecf-4838-4fbc-8fc8-c6b5db446aee" />



**Figure 10: Switching threshold analysis**

The calculated and simulated values are compared to understand the relationship between the theoretical equations and the actual device behavior.

---

## 1.11 Voltage Transfer Characteristic Analysis

The voltage-transfer curve provides a complete static representation of the CMOS inverter.

At low input voltage, the PMOS is ON and the NMOS is OFF, so the output remains close to the supply voltage. At high input voltage, the NMOS is ON and the PMOS is OFF, causing the output to approach ground.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (156)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1338976a-8783-4ca5-9e82-476e90324e4d" />


**Figure 11: CMOS inverter VTC**

The sharp transition in the VTC demonstrates the high voltage gain of the CMOS inverter around the switching region.

---

## 1.12 Comparison of Different Sizing Conditions

A second sizing condition is evaluated to observe how changing the transistor dimensions affects the inverter's switching characteristics.

Changing the PMOS/NMOS ratio modifies the balance between the pull-up and pull-down networks. This can shift the switching threshold and change the rise and fall delays.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (157)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2299ffa1-5019-49fb-b46b-df5d86c3f42d" />



**Figure 12: Comparison of inverter sizing conditions**

The simulation demonstrates why transistor sizing is an important step in standard-cell design.

---

## 1.13 Verification of Calculated Value

The values obtained from the simulation are verified using the calculated result. This provides an additional check on the measurements obtained from the waveform and characterization process.

The numerical verification helps ensure that the extracted parameter is consistent with the theoretical calculation.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (158)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53f7e58a-ceef-4f41-b9fb-6e8cbdc32188" />



**Figure 13: Verification of calculated simulation parameter**

Such verification improves confidence in the extracted timing and electrical characteristics.

---

## 1.14 Final Inverter Characterization

The final characterization summarizes the behavior of the selected CMOS inverter configuration.

The voltage-transfer characteristic, switching behavior and timing response are used together to evaluate whether the chosen transistor sizing provides the desired performance.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (159)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c2cf640-3a16-4c18-a33a-a0c48b71354d" />


**Figure 14: Final CMOS inverter characterization**

The characterization results provide the basis for proceeding towards the physical implementation of the standard cell.

# 2. SKY130A Standard-Cell Design Flow

## 2.1 Cloning the Design Repository

The standard-cell design environment is prepared by cloning the required repository into the OpenLane working directory.

Git is used to obtain the required source files, configuration files, technology information and supporting resources.
<img width="958" height="934" alt="gitcloning 2nd image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a9b140d8-4ff0-4579-b243-ceae1a28b9f7" />



**Figure 15: Cloning the standard-cell design repository**

Repository cloning ensures that the design environment contains all the files required for subsequent layout and physical-design activities.

---

## 2.2 Preparing the SKY130A Technology File

After cloning the repository, the required SKY130A technology file is copied into the appropriate standard-cell design directory.

The technology file contains important information required by the layout and physical-design tools to interpret the process layers and device structures correctly.
<img width="958" height="934" alt="3rd image sky130A tech is copied from magic to vsdstdcelldesign by using cp  command" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4e9d76b-11d9-481b-a26e-665468b324a9" />



**Figure 16: Copying the SKY130A technology file**

Correct placement of the technology file is essential for opening and processing the standard-cell layout using the SKY130A technology.

---

## 2.3 CMOS Inverter Layout

The CMOS inverter layout is opened using the layout editor. The physical arrangement of the PMOS and NMOS devices, contacts, diffusion regions, polysilicon and metal layers can be observed.

The layout represents the physical implementation of the transistor-level CMOS inverter designed during the simulation stage.
<img width="958" height="934" alt="4th image inverter layout" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5742fab9-ac85-4562-aa2d-be6d7464c84b" />



**Figure 17: SKY130A CMOS inverter layout**

A well-designed layout must satisfy the technology design rules while maintaining compact area and proper electrical connectivity.

---

# 3. 16-Mask CMOS Fabrication Process

The next part of the module explains the major stages involved in manufacturing a CMOS integrated circuit using a 16-mask process.

The fabrication sequence consists of repeated steps of oxidation, photolithography, implantation, deposition, etching and metallization. Each mask defines a specific physical region required to build the CMOS devices.

---

## 3.1 Selecting the Silicon Substrate

The fabrication process begins with the selection of a P-type silicon substrate.

The substrate provides the mechanical and electrical foundation on which the CMOS devices are fabricated. The substrate is selected with a controlled doping concentration, resistivity and crystal orientation.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (161)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98d1d7a1-5e96-431d-a2b9-e2f73c52b3a8" />



**Figure 18: Selection of P-type silicon substrate**

Starting with a controlled substrate is important because the substrate properties directly influence device characteristics such as threshold voltage, junction behavior and leakage.

---

## 3.2 Formation of Active Regions – Mask 1

The first mask is used to define the active regions in which transistors will eventually be formed.

Field oxide is grown over the regions that must be electrically isolated. The LOCOS process, or **Local Oxidation of Silicon**, is used to separate active device areas.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (162)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aff10a7-95a3-42ad-b3d5-5c0309004cc7" />



**Figure 19: Active region formation using Mask 1**

The field oxide prevents unwanted conduction between neighboring devices and provides electrical isolation.

The LOCOS structure also produces the characteristic **bird's-beak** region near the boundary of the field oxide.

---

## 3.3 P-Well Formation – Boron Implantation

The next stage forms the required well regions for complementary MOS devices.

Boron is a P-type dopant and is implanted into the selected region to form the P-well. The implantation energy and dose are controlled to obtain the required doping profile.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (165)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08190702-815f-4c72-b610-97fb8e0166ca" />



**Figure 20: P-well formation using boron implantation**

The P-well provides the body region in which the NMOS transistor will be fabricated. Proper well formation is essential for achieving the required threshold voltage and isolation.

---

## 3.4 N-Well Formation – Phosphorus Implantation

Phosphorus, which is an N-type dopant, is implanted into the selected region to form the N-well.

The N-well provides the body region required for the PMOS transistor in a CMOS process.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (166)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eea2bb2-1a04-4bab-bbce-cebec3cfb9a1" />



**Figure 21: N-well formation using phosphorus implantation**

The combination of N-well and P-well regions enables both PMOS and NMOS transistors to be fabricated on the same silicon substrate.

---

## 3.5 Gate Formation – Initial Structure

After the well regions are formed, the process moves towards gate formation.

The gate is one of the most important parts of a MOS transistor because it controls the formation of the conducting channel between source and drain.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (167)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af3ce00b-d164-453f-a816-0240d8722d5a" />



**Figure 22: Initial stage of gate formation**

The gate structure separates the control terminal from the semiconductor using a thin insulating oxide layer. This allows the MOS transistor to be controlled using an electric field.

---

## 3.6 Threshold Voltage and Body Effect

The threshold voltage of a MOS transistor is not constant under all operating conditions. It depends on the manufacturing process, substrate doping, oxide capacitance and source-to-body voltage.

The threshold-voltage equation includes the body-effect term, which represents the change in threshold voltage when the source and body are at different potentials.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (168)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08b2624d-7192-45c2-8d63-1af8ac178f9f" />



**Figure 23: Threshold voltage and body-effect analysis**

The body effect becomes particularly important when the source-to-body voltage changes. Understanding this effect is necessary for accurate transistor modeling and CMOS circuit design.

---

## 3.7 Gate Patterning – Mask 4

Photolithography is used to define the required gate pattern. A photoresist layer is deposited and exposed according to the mask pattern.

Mask 4 defines the region that is retained or removed during the subsequent processing step.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (169)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a492ef5b-3fa2-4c9b-a203-0bd4e646ea3b" />



**Figure 24: Gate formation using Mask 4**

Accurate gate patterning is critical because the gate length directly affects important transistor characteristics such as drive current, delay and short-channel behavior.

---

## 3.8 Gate Patterning – Mask 5

The next mask is applied to further define the required gate-related structure.

The photoresist acts as a temporary protective layer, allowing selected regions to undergo etching or processing while protecting the remaining regions.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (172)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c71bc4c-91f1-4c3b-a4a5-511ddf4187aa" />



**Figure 25: Gate processing using Mask 5**

This stage refines the physical gate structure and prepares the transistor regions for subsequent implantation steps.

---

## 3.9 Gate Patterning – Mask 6

Mask 6 is used during the continuation of the gate-processing sequence.

The patterned structure now provides the physical definition required for controlling the later source/drain implantation regions.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (173)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4606e4d-1daa-4ae8-b158-10d8e8d97dcd" />



**Figure 26: Gate formation using Mask 6**

The gate acts as the self-aligned reference for forming the source and drain regions, which is a key feature of modern MOS fabrication.

---

# 4. Lightly Doped Drain Formation

## 4.1 LDD Formation – Mask 7

The Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) process introduces lightly doped regions close to the transistor channel.

These regions reduce the electric field near the drain and help improve device reliability. The LDD structure is particularly important for reducing hot-carrier effects.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (174)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83e12ad6-00cd-43b7-b9da-4af0ec4bd789" />



**Figure 27: LDD formation using Mask 7**

The lightly doped extension provides a gradual transition between the heavily doped source/drain region and the channel.

---

## 4.2 LDD Formation – Mask 8

The complementary LDD implantation is performed for the opposite transistor type.

The correct dopant type is selected depending on whether the region belongs to the NMOS or PMOS device.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (175)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5014a7e-dbc5-40c7-820c-3cfecb867154" />



**Figure 28: Complementary LDD implantation using Mask 8**

The LDD process provides a balance between transistor drive capability and reliability by controlling the electric field near the drain.

---

# 5. Source and Drain Formation

## 5.1 Source and Drain Formation – Mask 9

After LDD formation, heavily doped source and drain regions are created.

The implantation is aligned with the gate structure so that the source and drain are positioned on either side of the channel.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (176)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a25c0e16-f874-4fb9-b54e-96fc86075bec" />



**Figure 29: Source and drain formation using Mask 9**

The heavily doped regions provide low-resistance electrical terminals for the MOS transistor while the region underneath the gate remains available for channel formation.

---

## 5.2 Source and Drain Formation – Mask 10

The complementary source/drain implantation is then performed for the opposite transistor type.

The NMOS and PMOS require opposite conductivity types for their source and drain regions.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (177)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a19c367-c638-4a29-9a6b-148632a9a514" />



**Figure 30: Complementary source and drain implantation**

At this stage, the essential transistor structures are present: wells, gate, source and drain. These structures form the basic building blocks of the CMOS inverter.

---

# 6. Contacts and Interconnect Formation

## 6.1 Local Contacts and Interconnects

Once the transistor regions are completed, electrical contacts are created to connect the device terminals to the interconnect layers.

The contact process provides a low-resistance electrical path from the source, drain and gate regions to the metal interconnect system.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (178)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6563950-7c0d-450b-ad24-42d353a4b0a4" />



**Figure 31: Formation of local contacts and interconnects**

The process includes cleaning and etching steps to ensure that the contact regions are properly prepared before metal deposition.

Proper contact formation is important because defects or high contact resistance can significantly affect circuit performance.

---

# 7. Higher-Level Metal Formation

## 7.1 Higher-Level Metal Interconnections

The final stage shown in this module is the formation of higher-level metal interconnections.

Metal layers are used to electrically connect different transistor terminals and different parts of the integrated circuit. Contact holes are opened where connections between different layers are required.
<img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (179)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b951251d-0461-40c9-8056-25eab941f27c" />


**Figure 32: Higher-level metal formation**

The final metallization stage converts the isolated transistor structures into a complete electrically connected circuit. Higher-level metal layers are essential for routing signals, power and ground throughout the chip.

# 9. Layout and Abstract View

The first stage of the design flow is the creation of the standard-cell layout using the SKY130A technology.

The layout represents the physical implementation of the CMOS circuit using the required layers such as:

- Metal layers
- Polysilicon
- Diffusion
- Contacts
- Well regions
- Power and ground connections

The corresponding abstract view represents the simplified physical information of the cell that can be used by the digital implementation flow.

The layout and abstract views are checked to ensure that the cell has the required physical structure and proper connectivity.
<img width="1372" height="611" alt="Screenshot (180)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59d161c4-e4a5-4b98-ba5c-19cf02977397" />



**Figure 1: Layout and abstract representation of the standard cell**

---

# 10. Defining the Cell Boundary

After creating the layout, a proper cell boundary is defined.

The boundary determines the physical area occupied by the standard cell. It is important because standard cells must follow a well-defined height and width so that they can be placed together during physical design.

The cell boundary also helps maintain:

- Consistent cell dimensions
- Proper placement
- Alignment with neighbouring cells
- Correct power and ground rail positions
- Compatibility with the standard-cell library

The layout is therefore organized inside the defined cell boundary.

The next step is to establish the power and ground connections of the cell.

For the CMOS standard cell:

- **VDD** provides the positive supply voltage.
- **GND** provides the reference/ground connection.

The power and ground segments are connected to the appropriate transistor terminals and are routed through the required layout layers.

Correct power and ground connectivity is essential for reliable circuit operation and for maintaining compatibility with the standard-cell architecture.

# 12. Layout Extraction

Once the physical layout is completed, the layout information is extracted to obtain the electrical representation of the circuit.

The extraction process identifies:

- Devices present in the layout
- Electrical connections
- Nodes
- Parasitic elements
- Device dimensions
- Power and ground connections

The extracted information is used to generate a SPICE-compatible representation of the physical layout.

This step is important because simulation of the extracted circuit provides a more realistic representation of the implemented layout than an ideal schematic-level simulation.

# 13. Generating the Extracted Netlist

After extraction, the generated files are checked in the working directory.

The extracted netlist contains the electrical information obtained from the physical layout. It provides the connectivity and device information required for circuit simulation.

The generated files are verified before proceeding to the SPICE simulation stage.

Typical files generated during this stage include the extracted layout information and SPICE-compatible netlist files.

# 14. Creating the SPICE File

The extracted circuit information is then used to prepare the SPICE simulation file.

The SPICE file contains:

- Technology/model information
- Cell subcircuit definition
- Input and output nodes
- Power supply connections
- Ground connections
- Transistor information
- Simulation parameters

The standard-cell subcircuit is defined using the extracted device parameters so that the physical implementation can be simulated using NGSPICE.

# 15. Transient Simulation using NGSPICE

The extracted SPICE circuit is simulated using NGSPICE.

Transient analysis is performed to observe how the output voltage changes with time when the input signal is applied.

The simulation setup applies a changing input signal while the cell is powered using the required supply voltage.

During simulation, the important nodes such as:

- Input
- Output
- VDD
- GND

are observed.

The initial simulation output confirms that the extracted circuit is electrically connected and can be simulated successfully.

# 16. Input and Output Waveforms

The final simulation result is observed using the generated transient waveform.

The input signal changes between logic LOW and logic HIGH. The CMOS inverter responds by producing the complementary output.

Therefore:

- When the input is LOW, the output becomes HIGH.
- When the input is HIGH, the output becomes LOW.

The waveform confirms the expected inverter functionality.

The simulated voltage levels are close to the expected supply and ground levels, demonstrating correct operation of the extracted standard cell.

# 17. Physical Verification and Layout Analysis

After completing the basic layout, the physical implementation is examined carefully to ensure that the required layers and connections are present.

The layout is checked for correct transistor formation, diffusion regions, polysilicon structures, contacts, metal routing, and power connections.

The purpose of this stage is to make sure that the physical representation corresponds to the intended CMOS circuit.

A properly constructed layout should maintain:

- Correct device connectivity
- Correct power distribution
- Proper cell boundary
- Valid layer usage
- Proper transistor arrangement

---

# 18. Standard Cell Layout Structure

The standard cell follows the conventional CMOS standard-cell arrangement.

The PMOS network is placed towards the upper portion of the cell and is associated with the VDD rail, while the NMOS network is placed towards the lower portion and is associated with the GND rail.

The input connection controls the gates of the transistors, while the output is obtained from the common connection between the pull-up and pull-down networks.

This arrangement allows the cell to provide complementary logic operation while maintaining a regular physical structure suitable for standard-cell libraries.

---

# 19. Extraction and Parasitic Information

Layout extraction converts the physical geometry into an electrical representation.

Unlike an ideal schematic, the extracted circuit can contain parasitic effects caused by the physical implementation.

These effects can influence:

- Propagation delay
- Rise time
- Fall time
- Output transition
- Dynamic behaviour

Therefore, extracted-layout simulation is an important step in validating whether the physically implemented cell behaves as expected.

---

# 20. SPICE Model and Device Parameters

The generated SPICE representation uses the SKY130A technology information to describe the devices used by the cell.

The transistor models contain the electrical parameters required by NGSPICE to calculate the behaviour of the MOS devices.

The extracted cell therefore represents the actual physical implementation more closely than an idealized circuit model.

This enables realistic verification of the standard cell before it is used in a larger digital design.

---

# 21. Simulation Setup

For transient analysis, suitable input stimulus and supply conditions are defined.

The supply voltage is applied between VDD and GND, while the input is driven using a time-varying digital waveform.

The simulation observes the response of the output node over time.

The main objective of the transient simulation is to verify:

1. Correct logic functionality
2. Proper voltage levels
3. Output transitions
4. Timing behaviour
5. Stability of the simulated circuit

---

# 22. CMOS Inverter Operation

The operation of the CMOS inverter is based on complementary switching of PMOS and NMOS transistors.

### Input LOW

When the input is LOW:

- PMOS turns ON.
- NMOS turns OFF.
- The output is connected towards VDD.
- Therefore, the output becomes HIGH.

### Input HIGH

When the input is HIGH:

- PMOS turns OFF.
- NMOS turns ON.
- The output is connected towards GND.
- Therefore, the output becomes LOW.

Hence, the output is the logical complement of the input.

---

# 23. Rise and Fall Behaviour

During a LOW-to-HIGH input transition, the output changes from HIGH to LOW.

During a HIGH-to-LOW input transition, the output changes from LOW to HIGH.

The finite slope visible in the waveform is due to the charging and discharging of the capacitances associated with the circuit.

Therefore, the practical output waveform does not change instantaneously.

The extracted parasitic components can further influence the transition behaviour.

---

# 24. Timing Behaviour

The transient waveform can be used to understand the timing characteristics of the standard cell.

Important timing parameters include:

- Rise time
- Fall time
- Propagation delay
- Input transition time
- Output transition time

These parameters are important when standard cells are used to construct larger digital circuits.

A faster cell provides better timing performance, while the physical implementation and transistor sizing can affect the delay and power characteristics.

---

# 25. Voltage Levels

The simulation verifies that the output reaches the expected logic levels.

The HIGH level approaches the supply voltage, while the LOW level approaches ground.

This confirms that the extracted cell provides proper digital logic behaviour.

The waveform therefore provides an important validation of both the logical operation and the electrical implementation of the cell.

---

# 26. Transistor Sizing and Performance

The dimensions of the PMOS and NMOS devices influence the electrical characteristics of the cell.

Device sizing affects:

- Drive strength
- Rise time
- Fall time
- Propagation delay
- Power consumption
- Switching behaviour

Proper sizing is therefore required to obtain a balanced and reliable standard-cell implementation.

The physical dimensions obtained during layout are also reflected in the extracted circuit used for simulation.

---

# 27. Layout-to-Simulation Correlation

One of the important objectives of this project is to establish a complete connection between physical design and circuit simulation.

The flow can be summarized as:

**Layout → Extraction → SPICE Netlist → NGSPICE Simulation → Waveform Analysis**

The layout defines the physical implementation.

The extraction process converts the physical implementation into an electrical representation.

The generated SPICE file is then simulated using NGSPICE.

Finally, the transient waveforms are analyzed to verify the behaviour of the implemented cell.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This module provided a complete understanding of CMOS inverter design from the circuit level to the physical implementation and fabrication level. The CMOS inverter was first analysed using SPICE to understand its electrical and switching behaviour. Its transient response, voltage transfer characteristics, switching threshold, rise and fall behaviour, and the influence of transistor sizing were studied in detail.

The design was then implemented as a SKY130A standard-cell layout. Important physical-design elements such as the cell boundary, PMOS and NMOS regions, power and ground rails, contacts, polysilicon, diffusion, and metal interconnects were considered during layout implementation.

The completed layout was extracted to obtain the corresponding electrical netlist. This extracted representation was simulated using NGSPICE, and the resulting waveforms were compared with the expected CMOS inverter behaviour. This step demonstrated how physical layout information affects the electrical representation of the circuit and how post-layout simulation can be used for verification.

In addition, the 16-mask CMOS fabrication process was studied to understand how the designed transistor structures are physically fabricated on a silicon wafer through multiple masking, implantation, deposition, etching, and metallization steps.

Thus, the module successfully demonstrated the complete **RTL-to-physical-design and CMOS implementation concept**, while providing practical exposure to **SPICE, NGSPICE, Magic VLSI, SKY130A PDK, layout extraction, standard-cell design, and CMOS fabrication technology**.
